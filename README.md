# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview  

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. This project focuses on functionality and modularity over visual design. The game runs in the browser and includes full game logic, a dynamic UI, and proper win/loss tracking.

## Features

- **Two-player mode** â€“ Players take turns automatically.
- **Win detection** â€“ Automatically identifies wins, losses, and ties.
- **Dynamic UI updates** â€“ The interface reflects real-time game progress.
- **Score tracking** â€“ Displays player wins and losses across multiple games.
- **Restart feature** â€“ Reset the board anytime with a single click.
- **Modular JavaScript** â€“ Organized using the module pattern.

## How It Works

1. **Players alternate turns** â€“ One selects "X," the other "O."
2. **Win/tie detection** â€“ The game automatically checks for three-in-a-row or a draw.
3. **Real-time updates** â€“ The UI displays results instantly.
4. **Score tracking** â€“ Wins and losses persist across multiple games.
5. **Restart feature** â€“ Reset the board anytime with a single click.

## Project Structure  

- `index.html` â€“ Contains the game layout.
- `style.css` â€“ Styles the game interface.
- `script.js` â€“ Implements the game logic and UI updates.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** â€“ Structuring the game layout.
- **CSS** â€“ Styling the game interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6)** â€“ Game logic and interactivity.
- **Module Pattern** â€“ Organized, modular JavaScript code.

## Future Enhancements
